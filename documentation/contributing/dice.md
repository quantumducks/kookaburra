Seek information and gain _knowledge_ about the specific error message you have encountered. Understand its implications
and what it signifies.

## 3: Determine the root cause

Using the knowledge obtained in step 2, analyze and identify the underlying cause of the error. Determine the exact
reason why it occurred.

## 4: Find a solution

Once the root cause has been identified, proceed to find a suitable solution for the problem at hand. Explore best
practices and recommended approaches to address and resolve the error effectively.
