# Development Requirements

## Unit of Work

[TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) is considered to be the way (but
not guarantee) to produce a *non-broken software*. Developer's unit of work is one completed
iteration of TDD cycle.

> *tl;dr-version*
> 1. If your tests are failing you must write code.
> 2. If your tests are passing you must write test, unless you're refactoring or done.
